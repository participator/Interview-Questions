            <p>Your server has received a package of N incoming requests. Handling the K-th request (for K from 0 to N âˆ’
                1) will take A[K] seconds.</p>
            <p>The load balancer has to drop two acquired requests and distribute the rest of them between three workers
                in such a way that each worker receives a contiguous fragment of requests to handle, and finishes
                handling them in exactly the same moment as the other workers. No two workers should receive the same
                request to compute.</p>
            <p>The load balancer's distribution of requests is performed by selecting two requests that will be dropped,
                and which will split the array into three contiguous parts that will be allocated to the workers. More
                precisely, if requests 2 and 5 are chosen by the load balancer from a package of 9 requests, then:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                    <li>the 0-th to 1-st requests will be handled by the first worker,</li>
                    <li>the 3-rd to 4-th requests will be handled by the second worker,</li>
                    <li>the 6-th to 8-th requests will be handled by the third worker.</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Such a distribution will be correct if each worker receives requests equalling the same total amount of
                handling time.</p>
            <p>Write a function <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">solution</tt> that, given an array A of N integers
                representing the time of execution of consecutive tasks, returns <tt
                    style="white-space:pre-wrap">true</tt> if it is possible for the load balancer to choose two
                requests that will determine an even distribution of requests among three workers, or <tt
                    style="white-space:pre-wrap">false</tt> otherwise.</p>
            <p><b><b>Examples:</b></b></p>
            <p>1. Given A = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2], the function should return <tt
                    style="white-space:pre-wrap">true</tt>, as choosing requests 2 and 5 results in a distribution
                giving 4 seconds of handling time to each worker, as explained in the following image:</p>

                    alt="The first worker will handle tasks with execution times 1 and 3, the second worker handles tasks with times 2 and 2
and the third worker handles tasks with times 1, 1 and 2. All workers will handle tasks with a total execution time of 4.">
            </p>
            <p>2. Given A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the function should return <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">false</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>3. Given A = [1, 2, 1, 2, ..., 1, 2] of length 20,000, the function should return <tt
                    style="white-space:pre-wrap">true</tt>.</p>
            <p>Write an <b><b>efficient</b></b> algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>
